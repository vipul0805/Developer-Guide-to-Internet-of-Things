This is the skeleton for Lesson 4. Please base your solution on the provided
structure. Note that for npm packages, the grader will not install new packages
--- you are limited to the ones already listed in package.json:

```
    "cfenv": "1.0.3",
    "express": "4.13.4",
    "ibmiotf": "0.2.11"
```

Also consider that you can only submit a single file for each of the
assignments, so except for the above packages and the Service which is loaded
by `require('./service')`, your code needs to be self-contained.
